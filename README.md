## Experience
### Taekwondo Athlete (Sep 2008 - Dec 2018)
- I started practicing Taekwondo back in 2008 when I was 7 years old. This sport has a competitive aspect which catched my eye since the beginning. Over the time, I started to compete only in Portugal tournaments.
My coach, at a certen time, decidede that I was ready to compete in foreign country's such as Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain and France.

### Taekwondo Coach (2016 - 2018)
- During my time as a Taekwondo athlete, I trained different age groups several times. These situations occurred when my coach was unable to give the training.
On the same day, three training sessions were taught, one for each age group, and all the planning for it was up to me, from warm-up to the technical part, adapted for each age group, using my experience as an athlete.
The first group included children from 4 to 7 years old, the second from 7 to 13 years old and, finally, over 14 years old.

## Volunteering
### Viagem Medieval em Terra de Santa Maria
- During the period from August 3 to 14, 2022, I participated in [Viagem Medieval](https://www.viagemmedieval.com/), held in Santa Maria da Feira as a volunteer.
I was assigned the function of "Support to Shows". My role as a volunteer consisted of several tasks: delimiting restricted and necessary areas for the performance of shows and carrying out their control; accompanying processions/parades and ensuring that they proceeded normally and safely; manage entrances to stands as well as their capacity. As this is an event that receives thousands of people daily, with the tasks I performed, I was able to gain experience in teamwork, interact with different
event visitors and deal with constant adverse situations. In addition, I worked together with civil protection.
In 2023, between 2 and 13 of August, I repeated the experience, being promoted to leader of 2 teams.
In 2024, I will be enrolled once again as a volunteer between 31 of July until 11 of August.
